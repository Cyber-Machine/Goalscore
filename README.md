# PB LIVESCORE PROJECT


## Project Idea:

This project proposes a Football LiveScore Project. It displays the scores of both the teams that are currently playing a match.
An authorized admin can update the scores while the match is in progress. The website will automatically fetch and display the LiveScores to the audience.
This project is going to be enhanced with additional features in the future.
